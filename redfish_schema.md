In the context of Redfish, a schema defines the structure and format of data
that is used to manage and control hardware in data centers.
Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Purpose of Redfish Schema
+ Redfish schemas provide a standardized way to represent various hardware components
and their properties.
This ensures consistency and interoperability across different systems and vendors.

2. formats
   + Redfish schemas are available in multiple formats, including
     - CSDL (Common Schema Definition Language): An XML-based format
     - JSON Schema: A JSON-based format.
     - OpenAPI Schema: Used for defining RESTful APIs.
3. Components:
   + Each schema defines a specific type of resource, such as servers, storage, or networking devices. For example
     - AccountService: Manages user accounts and their properties
     - Chassis: Represents the physical container for hardware components.
     - System: Describes a computer system, including its processors, memory, and other components.
4. Usage:
   + Redfish schemas are used by applications to interact with
   and manage hardware resources. They provide a clear and
   consistent way to access and modify hardware settings,
   monitor status, and perform other management tasks.
5. Example:
   + If an application needs to retrieve information about a server's memory,
   it would use the Redfish schema for the memory resource.
   This schema defines the properties and structure of the memory data,
   ensuring that the application can correctly interpret and use the information.

### system vs chassis ###
In the context of Redfish, System and Chassis refer to different aspects of hardware management
1. system
+ The System resource represents a logical view of a computer system. It includes properties and
components that are essential for the operation of the system, such as processors,
memory, storage, and network interfaces. Essentially,
it describes the functional aspects of a computer as seen from the operating system's perspective1.

+ Example properties:
  1. CPU details,
  2. memory configuration,
  3. storage devices, and
  4. network settings.

2. chassis
+ The Chassis resource represents the physical container that
houses the hardware components.
It includes properties needed to identify, locate, and service the hardware.
This resource provides a physical view of the system, focusing on the enclosure and its physical attributes
+ Example properties:
  1. Chassis type (e.g., rack, blade, tower),
  2. physical dimensions,
  3. power supply, and
  4. cooling information.

To summarize
+ System: Logical view focusing on the operational components and their configurations.
- Chassis: Physical view focusing on the enclosure and its physical attributes.
